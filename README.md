# employee-management-app

An app to manage employees efficiently. Made using React-Native, Redux and Firebase Authentication &
Database.
Using this app, a manager, after logging into the application can add employees, designate a schedule for them, and manage them efficiently. What's interesting here is that on just a click, the manager can send the schedule to the particular employee as text message. All the data is stored in the Firebase Realtime Database and efficiently managed using Redux within the application state.
